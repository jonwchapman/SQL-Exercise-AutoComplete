1. Add special markers to delimit splits.
2. Split on said markers into an array.
3. Remove the value that is being evaluated for autocomplete. (Initially, for phase 1 this will be the last item in the array.)
4. Push the value from ui.item.value onto the array. (The value in ui.item.value is the suggested item from the jquery autocomplete method)
5. Join the whole mess back into one object.
6. Remove special markers and replace with appropriate delimiters. (ie nbsp, line wrap, comma, etc)
7. ?????
8. Profit!
